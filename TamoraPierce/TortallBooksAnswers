1. What is Alanna's adoptive father's name?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Master Myles of Olau


          The correct answer was Sir Myles of Olau

          You learn that in the second book, "In the Hand of the Goddess", when Myles is going to war against Tusaine. He has
          plate armor and he is keeping Jonathan and his friends safe. You also learn it in "Alanna: The First Adventure".

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

2. What are Numair and Daine's childrens' names?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Carolyn and Richie


          The correct answer was Sarralyn and Rikash

          Rikash is for the Stormwing that had accepted Daine and who Daine accepted, and Sarralyn is after her mother.

3. What was Jonathan's grandfather's name?

[m_check] Your Answer: Jasson


          I know this because Jonathan's youngest son is named that, and he was called after his grandfather, the Old King.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

4. Who was the Ysander who found out Alanna's secret? (made her naked to show everyone that she was really a girl)?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Ylaklon


          The correct answer was Ylanda

          Ylira was trying to see her mind, but Ylanda is the one who found out. Ylon is the one she fences with, and I made up
          the other one.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

5. When does Thom die?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Jonathan's birthday


          The correct answer was Jonathan's coronation

          His last words to Alanna were "Love you always will..." and then he dies. Poor Alanna; that's when Si-Cham comes in
          and gives Alanna's magic to Jonathan. Then, Josianne comes in and she kills Si-Cham and then kills Faithful, Alanna's
          cat.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

6. How many people and animals (that Alanna knew closely) die at the end of "Lioness Rampant"?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: 7


          The correct answer was 6

          Si-cham, Thom, Liam, Faithful, Alex (she was his friend once) and Duke Roger of Conté. They all died in the last
          book, "Lioness Rampant". Her father didn't die in that book. I learned that he died in the second book. Duke Roger
          did too, but he was brought back to life by Thom, and then Roger was killed by Alanna in "Lioness Rampant".

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

7. What is Kel horrible at, besides climbing trees?

[m_check] Your Answer: carpentry


          That's the one she gets injured doing, and they refused to let her in to help. She did learn how to plow, slowly,
          with the help of the sparrows and well, there's really nothing to say about latrine duty. She could climb trees, she
          just didn't like to that much because she is sort of afraid of heights, but she got rid of her fear while at the
          Needle.
