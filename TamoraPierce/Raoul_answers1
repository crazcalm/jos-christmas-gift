1. What is the name of Raoul's family and their land holdings?

[m_check] Your Answer: Goldenlake


          Goldenlake is the name of the fief that Raoul's family owns. Malorie's Peak is the lands that Raoul receives after he
          is elevated to the peerage. Golden Lake is incorrect as there is no space in the Fief name. And of course, Naxen is
          the home fief of one of Raoul's friends, Gareth the younger.

2. Who was called 'Raoul's shy blonde shadow' in "Alanna: the First Adventure"?

[m_check] Your Answer: Francis of Nond


          Francis was a very minor character within "Alanna: the First Adventure", he was part of the group of friends that
          Alanna belonged to. Francis seemed to be closest to Raoul out of the group though. He died of the Sweating Sickness
          when it struck the Palace.

          The correct answer was f

          No, Raoul was the FIRST of Alanna's friends to fall ill with the Sweating Sickness.

4. In "In The Hand of the Goddess" who is Raoul's Squire?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: neither


          The correct answer was both of them

          There is a bit of confusion in the world of Tammy-verse as to who was Raoul and Gary's squire in "In the Hand of the
          Goddess", as Douglass of Veldine and Sacherall of Wellam seem to switch knight-masters.

          The correct answer was Curly black hair, solidly built, tall, black eyes

          Raoul is described as having tightly curling black hair, black eyes, and being "decidedly large".

6. Who sent Raoul to The Roof Of The World to fetch Alanna back from her adventures in "Lioness Rampant"?

[m_check] Your Answer: Jonathan


          It was Jonathan, who was "king-in-waiting" after his father's death. Raoul was the one Jon sent, and it was then that
          he first met Liam, Thayet, and Buri.

7. Which Bazhir tribe 'adopted' Raoul into their tribe?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Flying Winds


          The correct answer was Sandrunner

          In "Lioness Rampant" Raoul mentions that he was adopted by the Bazhir, but says that it was the Sandrunners, not
          Alanna and Coram's tribe, the Bloody Hawk. The tribe of Sunset Dragon was mentioned later on in "Squire" and Flying
          Winds is one I made up.

8. Alanna suggested Raoul first to be King's Champion rather than herself.

          Alanna suggested Raoul first, then Gary second. Jonathan said no, and that he liked where those two already were:
          Knight Commander of the King's Own and Prime Minister, respectively.

9. Who did Raoul formally arrest in "Wolf Speaker"?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Tristan


          The correct answer was Yolane

          It was Yolane, she had committed high treason to the crown, attempting to put herself on the throne, with Carthak's
          help. Daine had tracked Yolane down in wolf form when Raoul came across her. Numair turned Tristan, who was Yolane's
          pet mage and lover, into a tree. Belden was Yolane's husband, and he committed suicide before he could be discovered
          and arrested. And Gissa was one of the mages helping Tristan, it is unsure what happened to her.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

10. Where was Raoul at the closing of the Immortals War?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: hi hi


          The correct answer was Port Legann

          Raoul was involved in the battle for Legann, which was seen as the closing battle of the Immortals war. He even went
          up a giant snake like chaos-creature with three heads! (Stated in "Realms of the Gods")

11. By the Start of the "Protector of the Small" Quartet, What changes has Raoul made to the Own?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Made it into an effective combat unit


          The correct answer was All of these

          Yes, Raoul did do all of this. When he first came to the post of Knight Commander, the Own was a cosy assignment for
          young men who liked to meet pretty young ladies with doweries. He first of all made them into the combat unit that
          they started off as. Then he let Bazhir into the Own, which won him a few enemies from the conservatives. Then
          eventually, he expanded into the second and third companies.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

tall?

          In "First Test", Neal tells Kel that "It was only a 20 foot giant" that Raoul had killed.

13. By "First Test", what is Raoul's full title? (watch the spelling!)

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Raoul of Golden Lake and Mallory's Peak


          The correct answer was Raoul of Goldenlake and Malorie's Peak

          Goldenlake is Raoul's family, naturally, and Malorie's Peak is the lands that Raoul received when he was elevated to
          the Peerage. Pirate's Swoop is the lands that George Copper got when he became a Baron.

14. Who accused Raoul of taking Kel as his squire "Only because the Lioness asked you to" in "Squire"?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Lerant


          The correct answer was Flyndan

          Captain Flyndan of the Third Company was the one who voiced this accusation. Raoul admitted that Alanna had asked
          him, but he said that he had already thought about taking her on. Lerant thought that the only reason Raoul had taken
          Kel on because he felt sorry for her. Quasim was a member of the Own who thought highly of Kel, and had no problem
          with her riding with the Own. And I don't know what Wyldon thought of Raoul taking Kel on.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

16. Where did Kel suggest Raoul would hide at the Midwinter party in "Squire"?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: behind the curtains


          The correct answer was behind the wall hangings

          Behind the wall hangings, Kel told Buri they would see the lump behind the hangings if he was actually within the
          room. The nearby book room was where he actually was, talking with Gary, and then being part of the gathering to get
          Roald and Shinko together. And he definitely wouldn't go to the gardens, as they were a place for lovers.

17. What is the Knight Commander of the King's Own well known for?

[m_check] Your Answer: Avoiding social functions


          The answer is avoiding social functions. Raoul hates pretending to be nice to people he doesn't like. And Raoul has
          never beaten Wyldon at jousting, that is seen as near impossible. Also, the fact that Raoul never drank alcohol was
          known by very few people.

18. What creature does Raoul liken his Great-Aunt to?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: no


          The correct answer was Dragon

          Other accepted answers: female dragon  

          Raoul compares his Great-Aunt Seliba, his father's aunt, to a 'female dragon' in "Squire". This is why he dares not
          refuse the invitation to her midwinter party, which he did not see as an invitation, rather an 'Imperial demand'.

19. Raoul took Buri to his families Midwinter party on the basis that she wouldn't get any "romantic notions".

[m_check] Your Answer: True


          Yes. Raoul thought that Kel's idea of taking someone with him to discourage matchmaking mothers was good, but he was
          afraid that most women would think he'd meant something by at and he didn't want to hurt anyone, so he asked one of
          his closest friends... Although, if neither of them were gong to have any such notions, one could ask why they ended
          up in bed together. :D

20. What did Third Company name the fort that they built in "Squire", supposedly in honour of Raoul?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Steadfast


          The correct answer was Giantkiller

          It was Giantkiller, but knowing that Raoul would complain and protest at the name, Third company waited until he and
          Kel had gone back south for her ordeal before they named it. Mastiff, Steadfast and Northwatch are all other nearby
          forts, Mastiff being commanded by Lord Wyldon, Steadfast was where Raoul commanded from during the Scanran War for
          the duration of "Lady Knight", and Northwatch was headed by General Vagnet Ha Minch.

22. Which squad does Raoul ask to follow Kel and help her after he finds out Kel has gone after the refugees?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Lerant's squad

          Steadfast for the wedding celebrations. Buri had gotten tired of waiting for Raoul to come back down south at the end

24. Who does Raoul take on as his squire around the time of "Trickster's Queen"?

          is squired to Raoul. Prince Liam would have been a squire for at least three years already. (he's around the same age

[m_wrong] Your Answer: The coronation of the new Queen


          The correct answer was His sister's wedding
