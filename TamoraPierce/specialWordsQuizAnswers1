7. Aly's pack of spies refer to her a DUANI. What are they calling her?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: boss man

9. Yes or No - Does the word SCRY have anything to do with magic?

[m_check] Your Answer: y


          Scrying is the ability to look in the past, present, or future using magic. Many of the mages in the books scry for
          people. (Tamora Pierce did not invent this word, but it is one with which many people would be unfamiliar.)

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

10. Daja says that Sandry is her SAATI. What does this make Sandry?
