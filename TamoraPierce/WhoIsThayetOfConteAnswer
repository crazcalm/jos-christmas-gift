[m_wrong] Your Answer: One where she fell off a horse during a royal procession


          The correct answer was One where she tries to shoot monkeys in the dark after they wake her up

          Now, this is for those who really follow the books about Tortall. This story is mentioned by Aly (Alanna's daughter).
          The part that really get to Thayet is that she sleeps naked, and men were waking the monkeys up on purpose just to
          see her.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

10. Who is Thayet's friend who has been with her since they left Sarain?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Chani


          The correct answer was Buri

          Buri's mother and brother died with Kalasin in her mission to alert the Saren people of the mistreatment of the
          K'Miri people. Her family has been with Thayet and Kalasin's family for generations.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...
