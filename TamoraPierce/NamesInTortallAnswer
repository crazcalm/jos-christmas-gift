7. Alanna and George then had twins. The girl is named Alianne, which seems to be an original name - no other characters have
that name. The boy is named Alan. Who does he share a name with?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: George's cousin


          The correct answer was Alanna's father

          Alan shares a name with his grandfather. He was a stiff man much unlike Alanna, and he didn't care about his kids too
          much, he was too busy doing paperwork and the like. Also, Alan is the name that Alanna went by while going for her
          knighthood, since she had to pretend to be a boy.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

8. Alright. Next we'll talk about Daine and Numair's children. Their first child is named Sarralyn. Her name is original, but
who does it seem she is named after?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Numair's sister Lyn


          The correct answer was Daine's mother Sarra

          Sarralyn seems to be named after her grandmother, Sarra. Since she had Daine with a god, Weiryn, when she died she
          was able to become a goddess instead of going to the Black God's domain. She became the Green Lady who was a minor
          goddess. She is able to come and visit Daine only on holidays.

9. Daine and Numair also had a son named Rikash. Who is he named after?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Daine's deceased pet dog


          The correct answer was A stormwing

          Rikash is named after a stormwing. Although his kind was known to be evil and vulgar, Rikash was actually quite nice
          and he and Daine became good friends. It was at the moment of his death that Daine realised how much she really liked
          him.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

10. What are Sarai and Zaimid going to name their first child if it is a son?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Dunevon


          The correct answer was Mequen

          They are going to name their first child Mequen if it is a son, after Sarai's father. He was a good man who was good
          to his servants and slaves and was good to the raka too, who were discriminated against. He was killed by Sarai's
          lover, Bronau, who Sarai tried to kill after her father was stabbed, but in the end Sarai's sister, Dove, shot Bronau
          with arrows and killed him.
