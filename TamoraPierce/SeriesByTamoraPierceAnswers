1. The series take place in which places?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Galla and Scanra


          The correct answer was Tortall and Summersea

          "The Song of the Lioness" and "The Immortals" both take place in Tortall and the surrounding countries of that world.
          "The Circle of Magic" takes place in Summersea in Emlan, and in the surrounding countries/cities. I used Summersea
          and Tortall because they are the main settings.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

2. This one is on "The Song of the Lioness". Whom did Alanna eventually marry?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Halef Sief, Chief of the Bloody Hawk


          The correct answer was George Cooper, Baron of Pirate's Swoop

          Alanna ended up marrying George. She did not want to be queen of Tortall, and Liam ended up dying, protecting Jon
          from assassination.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

3. This is about "The Song of the Lioness". Who was Alanna's sponsor when she first became a page?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Jon


          The correct answer was Gary

          Gary was Alanna's sponsor, and he was the only one to know, besides George and Jon, about Alanna's being a girl. When
          she told him, he thought it was a great joke, and agreed to help Jon with Alanna's rite of knighthood.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

4. This is about "The Song of the Lioness". What color was Duke Roger of Conte's original magic?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: rusty-brown


          The correct answer was orange

          Roger's magic was orange, but when Thom brought him back from the dead, Roger's magic was blood-red. Alanna noticed
          it when his magic began leaking into the Trebond purple, thereby tinting Thom's magic.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

6. This is about "The Immortals". What was Numair's given name?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Arram King


          The correct answer was Arram Draper

          Numair's given name was Arram Draper. He changed it to Numair Samalin because he somehow offended the Emperor Ozorne
          of Carthak, and ordered to be captured and brought to Carthak so he could be imprisoned or killed.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

7. This is about "The Immortals". Who is Daine's mother as a goddess?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: the Lady of the Earth


          The correct answer was the Green Lady

          Daine's mother, as the Green Lady, will appear above Snowsdale's town well. The women of the town ask her advice on
          childbirth, and other womanly concerns. As Sarra said, the Great Mother cannot be everywhere at once.

10. What are Sandry, Tris, Daja, and Briar's magics, respectively?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: plant, thread, weather, and metal magic


          The correct answer was thread, weather, metal, and plant magic

          All of the children's magics are so rare, normal magic finders couldn't see it, and it took the mage Niklaren Goldeye
          to find it.
