[m_wrong] Your Answer: True


          The correct answer was f

          She was used to being ignored, and had a rather low opinion of men because of it. She was quite impressed and pleased

[m_check] Your Answer: Daine


          She and Onua told Daine about a very expensive dress that Thayet ruined by rushing out to fight, and how Jon wasn't
          even mad about it-he just recommended she remembered to change next time.

7. How did Buri become the head of the Queen's Riders?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: she was promoted


          The correct answer was Thayet had too many other things to do

          Thayet was the head of her Riders for a long time but left many tasks to Buri as her second-in-command. After a
          while, she figured she might as well fully step down because she just had too much to do!
