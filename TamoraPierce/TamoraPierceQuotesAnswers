1. Alanna: The First Adventure.
"Ah. 'Free time.' I've heard about that. Don't fool yourself, Fire-Top. What with the extra hours of lessons for punishments,
and the work you get everyday, free time is an illusion. It's what you get when you die and the gods reward you for a life
working from dawn until midnight. We all face up to it sooner or later."

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Alex


          The correct answer was Gary

          Gary says this to Alanna - or "Page Alan" as they all thought she was - when she discovers just how hard becoming a
          knight will be.

"The ground bloodied yer nose, spilt yer lip, and punched ye in th' eye, all at once. Would ye prefer to say 'twas yer pony?"
