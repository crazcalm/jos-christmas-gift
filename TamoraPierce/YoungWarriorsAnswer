2. In "The Magestone", what are the merpeople's enemy called?

[m_check] Your Answer: The Creesi


          "The Magestone" is by the husband and wife team S.M. and Jan Sterling. The Creesi and humans are two different
          peoples, just to clear that up.

          Fun Author Facts: The 'S' in S.M. stands for Steve. Jan's first story was published in a "Chicks in Chainmail"

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Bob White


          The correct answer was John Keats

          "Heartless" is by Holly Black. The quote by John Keats is from "Endymion".

          The while they feel thine airy fellowship.

          Kissing dead things to life."

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Trinidad

          Fun Author Facts: Pamela has a degree from UC Berkley and went on an excavation at Meroe, Sudan, which was the
          ancient capitol of Kush (yes, this was a real place).

6. True or False: The story "Thunderbolt" is actually a chapter from the book "Nobody's Princess".

[m_wrong] Your Answer: True


          The correct answer was False

          "Thunderbolt" is by Esther Friesner. This short story, though not in "Nobody's Princess", inspired the making of the
          novel. The story is based on the young life of Helen of Troy/Sparta. I have the book and think it's very good.

          Fun Author Facts: Esther has written over 30 novels and over 100 short works, once wrote an advice column and has won
          the Nebula Award.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

8. In the beginning of "The Boy Who Cried 'Dragon'", what is NOT mentioned as "a part of our culture"?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Michael Jordan


          The correct answer was Santa Claus

          "The Boy Who Cried 'Dragon'" is by Mike Resnick. Here is the paragraph the question was from:

          "You've all heard the story about the boy who cried 'Wolf!'
          Teachers and parents have been using it to teach children a lesson for centuries now. It's become a part of our
          culture. Everybody knows about the boy who cried 'Wolf!', just as everyone knows about the Three Blind Mice, and the
          little Dutch boy who put his finger in the dike, and the night Michael Jordan burned the Celtics for a 63 point
          playoff game."

          Fun Author Facts: Mike has won four Hugos and is published internationally.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...
