3. What is the name of the immortal that hunts for thieves?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Dragon

          Triston in "Wolfspeaker" used a coldfang to guard his study.

4. Which immortal knows every language there is and is extremely tall?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Dragon


          The correct answer was Basilisk

          Tkaa, from "The Immortals" and "Protector of the Small" is a basilisk. He can speak human, dragon and everything

9. How do dragons speak?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: In both of those ways


          The correct answer was In whistles and clucks

          Daine could not understand her when Kit spoke to Tkaa and when she unlocked things with her magic because Kit speaks
          in whistles and clucks and clicks. To communicate they mind-speak.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

10. Finally, where do most immortals live?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Realms of the dead


          The correct answer was Realms of the gods

          The immortals were sealed in the Realms of the gods by human mages. When the gate in between broke a lot came through
          to the human realms but a lot stayed.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...
