1. "Alanna: The First Adventure".
When Prince Jonathon snuck off to the Black City, Alanna went with him. However, when they got there they had to face the
Ysandir - "immortals" who feed on the lives of mortals. Which Ysandir did Alanna fence with?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Ylanda


          The correct answer was Ylon

          Almost everyone thought Alanna was a boy. During their battle with the Ysandir, Ylander stripped Alanna of her
          clothes and exposed her true identity. Jon was shocked, but enough of a gentleman to give Alanna his tunic to wear.

2. "In the Hand of the Goddess".
After Tortallan spies reported that the King of Tusaine was considering retaking the Drell River Valley on the Tortallan
border, an embassy from Tusaine came to court at Tortall. Everyone knew that Mikal of Danna, the Tusaine Ambassador, had
actually come to see if King Roald had the stomach for war. Who was Ambassador Mikal's wife?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: hi hi


          The correct answer was Lady Aenne

          Ambassador Mikal claimed that Tusaine had done better in the fighting arts than Tortall had; however, Jonathon
          assured him that even Tortall's pages and squires knew how to defend themselves against a knight. To prove his point,
          Jonathon arranged for Alanna - his personal squire - to fence Tusaine knight Dain of Melor.

3. "The Woman Who Rides Like a Man".
Whilst in the desert, Alanna and Coram are accepted into the Bloody Hawk tribe of the Bazhir. After Coram leaves to deliver a
message to Jon, Alanna kills Akhnan Ibn Nazzir, becomes the tribe's shaman, and starts training replacement shamans. Which of
her students plays with balls of coloured fire?

[m_check] Your Answer: Kourrem


          Coram had a lot to say to Alanna when he returned: "I think I'm leavin' ye in a fairly quiet place. Ye weren't well
          enough known here that ye could get into any trouble, and I thought they'd stay away from ye. But I come back, and
          ye're the Mother-blessed shaman of the tribe, ye've adopted three young ones, and ye're forcin' the women to accept

8. "Realms of the Gods".
A Chaos vent serves as the god's window into the home off Uusoae, the Queen of Chaos. When Daine first saw one of these vents
she almost touched it. Who stopped her?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Numair


          The correct answer was A Striped Skink

          If you look into a Chaos-vent it pulls first your mind, and then the rest of you, into the realms of Chaos.
