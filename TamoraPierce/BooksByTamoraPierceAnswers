1. Who is the main character in the *first* quartet by Tamora Pierce?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Giles of Aigidion


          The correct answer was Alanna of Trebond

          Keladry of Mindelan was the heroine in the quartet "Protector of the Small". The other two choices are made up.
          Alanna grew up in Fief Trebond with her twin brother Thom. Thom becomes a sorcerer and gets killed during Alanna's
          years as a knight.

2. Of what species is Tkaa?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: A dragon


          The correct answer was A basilisk

          We first meet Tkaa when he saves Daine and the Long Lake Pack from a Coldfang by turning it to stone. Basilisks often
          eat stone, and like the taste of black opals the most.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

3. What color robe is Numair?

[m_check] Your Answer: Black


          Black robe is the highest that any sorcerer can achieve. At the time of "The Immortals" quartet, there were only
          seven in the world. It is a highly risky position, too. Numair is very old for a black robe, and he is only in his
          30s!

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

4. What is the last book in "The Circle Opens" quartet called?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Weather Mage


          The correct answer was Shatterglass

          I found this out by going to Amazon.com. I have too much time on my hands! This book is also in stores now, but only
          in hardback.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

5. Does Lark take a new apprentice eventually?

[m_check] Your Answer: y


          He was described as "shy". He takes Sandry's place when she goes on to better things, such as training her
          apprentice, Pasco.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

6. What type of magic does the Acalon family usually accept? (Not Pasco's magic, and is keeping with their jobs)

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Dance Magic


          The correct answer was Harrier Magic

          Pasco is the exception; he has Dance Magic. The rest of the family are Harriers. The ones that have any kind of magic
          have Harrier Magic, usually. They all work for Duke Vedris, fighting crime.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

8. What is Keladry's biggest fear?

[m_check] Your Answer: Heights


          Keladry is deathly afraid of heights until the end of "Page." She has to rescue her maid at the top of a tower, and
          afterwards only detests heights. It was better than before, when she would throw up or freeze near a cliff.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

9. Where does Alanna live?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Yamani Islands


          The correct answer was Pirate's Swoop

          She moves into the Barony of Pirate's Swoop with her husband, George. George was given the property and title of
          Baron so that Jonathan wouldn't have to arrest him. George is good friends with Jonathan, although they fought over
          Alanna.
