[m_check] Your Answer: 17


          When Alanna first meets George with Gary in 'Alanna: The First Adventure', he says he is seventeen and recently
          became the King of Thieves. Alanna says that he seems older.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

2. Name a person in George's court.

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Coram


          The correct answer was Marek

          Coram was Alanna's guardian. He is typically against thieves, so he would never be part of George's court. Marek is a
          young thief who was constantly giving George trouble. He wanted to be the King of Thieves.

4. In what book did Alanna and George declare their love affair?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: 'Alanna: The First Adventure'


          The correct answer was 'The Woman Who Rides Like a Man'

          After Alanna fought with Jon, she went to see George in Port Caynn where he was teaching some disloyal thieves a
          lesson.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

his____heart"

[m_wrong] Your Answer: fish, broken


          The correct answer was fish, crooked

          accurately, that Claw is of noble birth.

                                                                                          I see an error - submit correction...

7. In the fourth book, 'Lioness Rampant', Jon gives George a royal pardon. What place does Jon want to give George in his
kingdom?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Provost


          The correct answer was second-in-command spymaster

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Aly-spymaster, Thom-scholar, Alan-knight

10. What fief is George a baron to?

[m_wrong] Your Answer: Trebond


          The correct answer was Pirate's Swoop

          That makes George's name to be George of Pirate's Swoop.
